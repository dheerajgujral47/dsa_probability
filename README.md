# There are a, b, c number of red, blue, green balls in a bag.
# 2 draws were made, each for 2 balls, without replacement.
# Calculate the probability for getting both balls of same color in the 3rd draw.

# The function calcProbability() takes 3 parameters for number of balls for each color
# and returns the required probability.
